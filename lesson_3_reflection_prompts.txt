When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is ideal when you want to work on multiple computers or if you collaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have total control of the state of your code, in case multiple people are working on the same file/project
